# g-react-redux-boilerplate
### This is my own React-Redux boiler plate that I use when starting or testing out new projects

I know that there is quite a bit of React-Redux boiler plates out there, but I never seemed to find one that really matched everything that I wanted, number one, something that I really wanted was a really straight forward approach to a React-Redux boilerplate.
Something that includes all the important parts of the React eco system

This boiler plate includestumb

1. React
2. Redux/React-Redux
3. React Router v4

### Very useful addons included:
- react-router-redux
- redux-thunk
- redux-promise
- redux-devtools ready

## and scaling your app from here will be easy!

Another thing I REALLY like about how I made this is that.

Webpack outputs 2 files that you include with the index.html, it includes an overall styles.css, and an overall bundle.js

everything compiles from main.scss, feel free to create as many scss files as you want, just as long as you import it into main.scss, you can put all of your variables into your scss files along with the nested goodness that comes with it.
